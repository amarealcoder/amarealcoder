#### I am a Front-End Web Developer and Technical Writer
I enjoy creating responsive web pages and articles that are beginner-friendly. 

I write technical articles about web development and tooling for productive development.

When I am not coding or writing, I become the best dancer in front of my mirror. I sometimes design and make adorable dresses.
